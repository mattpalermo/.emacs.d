#+Title: Emacs for the Modern Mortal

This is my Emacs configuration. I've only just begun to use Emacs so it's still a work in progress but it's already pretty good. As the README title suggests, the goal is to make Emacs somewhat accessible and appealing to a modern GUI user. Although it will still probably be necessary to learn a bit about Emacs to use it.

* Some goals/features
- Familiarity :: Enabled modern GUI keybinding (C-x, C-c, C-v, shift select etc), Familiar mouse interface (as much as possible), not too far from vanilla Emacs.
- Mouse and trackpad support :: Mouse menus, smooth scrolling, avoid middle mouse button dependence.
- Discoverability, help and hints :: Auto-completion, spell check, always highlight current line, parenthesis highlighting.
- Beauty :: Vibrant yet conservative colour theme, Beautiful fonts, Proportional fonts and varying text size where appropriate, modern cursor appearance.
- Nice writing environment :: Olivetti mode and visual line mode for sane and aesthetically pleasing text wrapping (TODO). Don't use auto-fill if possible. Text mode themes inspired by Tex, Tufte CSS and MS Word.
- Speed :: Try to keep the refreshingly fast nature of vanilla Emacs.
- Good Defaults :: UTF-8 by default (Windows problem), maximised on startup, time and battery in mode-line for fullscreen, trash/recycling bin support, bell disabled for sanity, disable configure GUI effects (too volatile for me).
- No setup required :: Auto download necessary packages.

* Usage Notes
- Just copy (or ~git clone~) this ~.emacs.d~ directory/folder into either ~~~ for Mac and Linux or ~C:/Users/Your Name/AppData/Roaming~ for Windows to get started. Of course you'll need Emacs installed.
- The first time Emacs starts it will take a few moments for some extra packages to be installed. A warning will be displayed about the "dashboard" package, don't worry about this.
- You will need Ispell, Aspell or Hunspell installed for spell checking to work. This will be easy for Mac and Linux. For windows, if you have trouble, ask for help. I'd love an excuse to try make a Hunspell installer for Windows.
- The fonts used in this configuration will need to be installed on your system. They are:
  + ET Book :: <https://edwardtufte.github.io/et-book/>. A nice "Book" like font that is designed with displays in mind. Not sure about this one yet. "Latin Modern" or "DejaVu Sans Serif" might also be good alternatives.
  + Inconsolata :: <https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata>. A nice to read monospaced font with a narrow spacing to accompany a serif font. I'd love to try the elegant "Triplicate" font one day if get my hands on it.
- I've set the Configure GUI settings to be ignored and placed into ~~\.emacs.d\custom.el~. They are ignored because I have issues with settings appearing here when themes with variables are applied. What makes this worse is that disabling the theme doesn't remove the settings.
- It seems that CUA mode does overwrite some default Emacs key-bindings like =C-v=. I hope this won't become an issue.

* To-Do
- [ ] Olivetti mode package. Configure default page width. Add hook to Text mode to turn on visual line mode and olivetti mode.
- [ ] Visual line mode for prog mode as well?
- [ ] Org image width. Use org-image-actual-width if no better alternative.
- [ ] Org mode shift selection.
- [ ] Info mode header themes. And other headers any other headers left as well.
- [ ] Header face (for setting the header font independent of the body font).
